Ph3 27.10.22.R: Code used to analyse intensity values for P-H3, Sox32 and Tbx16 from segmented nuclei in flat mounted embryos, related to figure 2J.

3D segementation images used in figure 2J were prepared using CellPose and Trackmate as described in the methods section, and the PH3 channel signal was analyzed in 3D using the 3D segmentation in CellProfiler using the Luca_Fish_PH3.cppipe pipeline.
