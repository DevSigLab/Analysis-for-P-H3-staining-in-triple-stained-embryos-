# Nuclear-segmentation-on-flat-mounted-embryos for outputting cell coordinates and nuclear intensities


total_segment_all_no_smoothing_3_channel_v and total_segment_all_no_smoothing_4_channel_v3: code used to segment cell nuclei and perform quantification for 4 channel or 3 channel images beside for data reported in Figure 2J


Luca_Fish_Ph3.cppipe and Luca_Fish_Ph3.cpproj: code used for 3D segementation of images used in figure 2J which were prepared using CellPose and Trackmate as described in the methods section, and the PH-3 channel signal was analyzed in 3D using the 3D segmentation in CellProfiler. 


Ph3 27.10.22.R: Code used to analyse intensity values for P-H3, Sox32 and Tbx16 from segmented nuclei in flat mounted embryos, related to figure 2J.
